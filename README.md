This project contains three Power BI dashboards from **PwC Switzerland - PowerBi Job Simulation** designed to provide insights into different areas of business performance: Call Centre Analytics, Customer Churn, and Diversity & Inclusion.

1. Call Centre Analytics Dashboard:
This dashboard provides an overview of call center performance, focusing on metrics such as resolution rates, customer satisfaction, and agent efficiency.

Average Satisfaction Rating: 3.40/6.81 (below target; improvement needed).
Resolution Rate: 72.92% of calls are resolved, but 27% remain unresolved.
Average Speed of Answer: 67.52 seconds across all agents.
Agent Performance: Jim answers the most calls but has the lowest satisfaction score (3.39); Martha and Joe have better satisfaction and speed of answer metrics.
Key Focus: Improve call resolution times and enhance customer satisfaction by refining agent training and workflows.

2. Customer Churn Dashboard:
This dashboard highlights customer churn risks and provides demographic, payment, and subscription data to identify trends.

1,869 customers at risk of churn.
Payment Methods: 57.30% use electronic checks; higher churn risk with mailed checks and credit cards.
Contract Types: 88.55% of customers are on month-to-month contracts, which increases churn risk.
Services Subscribed: Bundling services could reduce churn as 50% of customers have multiple lines.
Key Focus: Implement customer retention strategies through long-term contracts and targeted offers based on payment method and service usage.

3. Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard:
This dashboard assesses hiring, promotion, and turnover trends by gender and job level, offering insights into diversity performance.

Hiring: 59% of new hires are male, with significant gender gaps at the executive level.
Promotions: Males are promoted more frequently, with women facing longer wait times, particularly at senior levels.
Turnover: Higher turnover among female executives and directors, indicating retention challenges.
Key Focus: Improve gender parity in hiring and promotions, and address turnover among senior female employees through inclusive retention programs.
