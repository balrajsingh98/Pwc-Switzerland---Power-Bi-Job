Insights from the uploaded dashboards:
1. Call Centre Analytics Dashboard:
Overview: This dashboard provides a snapshot of call center performance, focusing on agent activity, resolution rates, customer satisfaction, and call handling speed.

Average Satisfaction Rating (3.40): Below the midpoint (4.50), indicating that customer satisfaction could be improved. Focus areas could include agent training or improved response times.

Resolution Rate (72.92%): A large portion of calls are being resolved (3.65K out of 5K+). This is positive, but the dashboard highlights that nearly 27% of calls are unresolved, which could be a pain point.

Speed of Answer (67.52 sec): While the average speed of answering calls is under a minute, further improvements could enhance customer satisfaction, especially for calls that are not getting resolved promptly.

Agent-wise Performance:

Martha and Joe perform best in terms of average speed and satisfaction ratings, while Jim answers the most calls but has the lowest satisfaction score (3.39).
Stewart and Diane have slightly better satisfaction ratings (3.40–3.41), but their speed of answer could be optimized.
2. Churn Dashboard:
Overview: This dashboard focuses on customer churn risk, with an emphasis on demographics, payment methods, contract types, and the services customers are signed up for.

Customers at Risk (1,869): The number of customers flagged as being at risk is high, representing a significant percentage of the customer base. This may require immediate action through tailored retention strategies.

Payment Method Insights: A majority of customers (57.30%) use electronic checks, with smaller portions opting for mailed checks or bank transfers. There could be a correlation between certain payment methods and churn risk—customers using mailed checks or credit cards could be examined further.

Contract Types: Most customers (88.55%) have month-to-month contracts, which are generally associated with higher churn risks. Long-term contracts (e.g., two-year plans) seem uncommon (2.57%), suggesting a need for initiatives that incentivize long-term commitments.

Services Subscribed:

Almost half (50%) of the customers have multiple lines, and a significant percentage have additional services like phone service (91%), streaming TV (44%), and tech support (17%).
Offering bundled packages could improve retention by increasing perceived value.
3. Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard:
Overview: This dashboard analyzes the hiring, promotions, and turnover trends across genders and job levels to highlight diversity and inclusion performance.

Hiring Trends:
59% of hires are male, while 41% are female, indicating a slight gender imbalance in hiring practices.
The imbalance is most notable at the executive and senior management levels, where male hires significantly outpace female hires (88% to 13% in the executive tier).
Promotion Trends:
Promotions also skew male, particularly at higher levels (senior manager and above), although there's more gender parity at lower levels like junior officers.
The average time to promotion shows that it takes female employees longer to get promoted at higher levels compared to males, indicating potential gender bias in the promotion process.
Turnover Rate:
Turnover is relatively high for both genders, particularly at the executive and director levels, with females experiencing slightly higher turnover rates.
FY20 turnover rates show an uptick, particularly for female executives and directors, suggesting a retention issue among women at senior levels.
Recommendations:
Call Centre:
Focus on reducing call resolution times and increasing satisfaction rates by enhancing agent training and optimizing workflows for unresolved calls.
Specific attention should be paid to agents like Jim, who handles the most calls but lags behind in satisfaction.
Customer Churn:
Prioritize long-term contract promotions and reward programs to reduce churn among month-to-month customers.
Further investigate the link between churn and payment methods or services to identify at-risk customer segments for targeted retention strategies.
Diversity & Inclusion:
Develop programs that target improving gender balance at the senior management and executive levels.
Address promotion gaps by implementing fairer and more transparent promotion policies to help reduce the time to promotion for women.
Improve retention strategies to prevent the high turnover rates seen among women at senior levels.
